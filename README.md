# Portfolio

## Summary
A site to showcase some of my web projects. This site is a work in progress that will continue to grow as I complete new projects.

## Tech
Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery

## Challenges
Coding the image slider in the projects section was definitely the most challenging part. I originally had that section hardcoded in HTML but then refactored it to dynamically populate the section using Javascript.
